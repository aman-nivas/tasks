    <h1 align="center">HUMAN TRAFFICKING</h1>
    <p>
        Human trafficking is the process of trapping people through the use of violence, deception or coercion and
        exploiting them for financial or personal gain. It is a form of modern slavery.

        In the immediate aftermath of a disaster, displacement is likely to occur, giving space for traffickers to
        operate and exploit affected people and their desire for safety. Men, women and children are being exploited
        when they are most vulnerable â€“ which is the horrific reality for millions of disaster survivors.
    </p>

    <p>
        Human Trafficking can take many forms during a disaster, most commonly:

        Forced labor
        Domestic servitude
        Sexual exploitation (and abuse)
        Recruitment for combat or gangs (more common in crisis situations)
        (And more recently) organ trafficking
