                <p>
                    Human Trafficking is the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of people
                    through force, fraud or deception, with the aim of exploiting them for profit. Men, women and
                    children of all ages and from all backgrounds can become victims of this crime, which occurs in
                    every region of the world.
                </p>
                <p>According to scholar Kevin Bales, author of Disposable People (2004), estimates that as many as 27
                    million people are in "modern-day slavery" across the globe. In 2008, the U.S. Department of
                    State estimates that 2 million children are exploited by the global commercial sex trade. In the
                    same year, a study classified 12.3 million individuals worldwide as "forced laborers, bonded
                    laborers or sex-trafficking victims". Approximately 1.39 million of these individuals worked as
                    commercial sex slaves, with women and girls comprising 98% of that 1.36 million.</p>
